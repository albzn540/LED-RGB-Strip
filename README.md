# FastLED with alot of animations and added functionality

## Introduction
This codebase is a merge between other peoples animations and some other nice to have features. Such ass support for buttons and controlling the leds through them.

I made this codebase with the thought that I could use it to quickly start working on new led-based project. Since almost all of them have some things in common, such as animations, controlling speed, brightness, pattern, palette and so on.

## Tested on
So far, only the ESP8266.  
However, it should work on the ATtiny and other AVR microprocessors if you just remove all WiFi related stuff from the code. I've seperated the code into different `.h` files so it should be very easy.

## Note
I haven't created all of the animations myself, most of them is created by some other artistic genius. Creds to those people.
